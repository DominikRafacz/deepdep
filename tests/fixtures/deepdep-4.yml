        Boosting, which is an efficient implementation\u000aof the gradient boosting
        framework from Chen & Guestrin (2016) <doi:10.1145/2939672.2939785>.\u000aThis
        package is its R interface. The package includes efficient linear\u000amodel
        solver and tree learning algorithms. The package can automatically\u000ado
        parallel computation on a single machine which could be more than 10\u000atimes
        faster than existing gradient boosting packages. It supports\u000avarious
        objective functions, including regression, classification and ranking.\u000aThe
        package is made to be extensible, so that users are also allowed to define\u000atheir
        own objectives easily.","License":"Apache License (== 2.0) | file LICENSE","URL":"https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost","BugReports":"https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/issues","NeedsCompilation":"yes","VignetteBuilder":"knitr","Suggests":{"knitr":"*","rmarkdown":"*","ggplot2":">=
